# CU_Beamer

## Description
A University of Illinois themed [Beamer](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer) template. Essentially, this is a palette tailored for `Madrid` theme. It works with other themes as well, however, since it is not fine-tuned for all of them, visual nuisances maybe found on occasion.

## Palettes and Logos
University of Illinois has in fact published several versions of the official color palette. The most notable ones are the "old" bold palette (Blue:`#003C7D`, Orange:`#F47F24`), which went through some minor changes in 2015; and the recent sesquicentennial palette (Blue:`#131F33`, Orange:`#FA6300`). The latter features a much darker blue and a brighter orange.

## Usage
Makesure both `.sty` files and `.tex` file are in the same folder. Use `\usecolortheme{CUbold}` to activate the bold palette or `\usecolortheme{CUacademic}` to activate the sesquicentennial palette, then modify and compile `cu_beamer.tex` as usual. 

The I-mark logo and the sesquicentennial logo (converted from `eps` format) are also included. For more details on palettes and logo downloads, follow the link in the reference section.
